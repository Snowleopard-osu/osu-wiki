# Graveyard

The **graveyard** is a subforum for [beatmapsets](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets) that have been abandoned by their creator(s). Graveyarded maps do not count towards a user's total upload limit. The [beatmapset host](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets/Beatmapset_host) may "revive" a beatmapset by updating it. This requires a free pending slot and sends it back to being a [Work in Progress](/wiki/Beatmaps#work-in-progress-and-pending) beatmapset.

Beatmaps that are not updated by their creator for **28 days** will automatically be sent to the Graveyard.
